//Write a Java program that takes a person's age as input and determines whether they are allowed to vote or not based on the age. If the person is 18 years or older, they should be allowed to vote, otherwise, they should not. Can you write the program for this?

package ConstructorsMethods;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Method3 {
    
    void age(int x)
    {
        if( x >= 18)
        {
        System.out.println("You're allowed to vote");

        }
        else
        {
            System.out.println("You're not allowed to vote");
        }
        
    } 
public static void main(String[] arg)
{
    Method3 obj = new Method3();
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Enter your age: ");
    int num1 = sc.nextInt();
    obj.age(num1);

}
